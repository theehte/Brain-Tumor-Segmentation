# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
This research includes 3D brain MRI images of tumor segmentation using different CNN architectures: SegNet, V-Net, and U-Net. Implemented a novel architecture of UNet with the latest methodologies in which a symmetrical encoder-decoder design is formed with Leaky ReLU activation, dropout layers, and batch normalization layers for regularization and GELU activation to preserve spatial information. Medical Segmentation Decathlon datasets are used to train and test models in experimentation. The research evaluates these models based on complexity, training time, and segmentation accuracy. U-Net emerges as the top performer with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 88.5%, surpassing V-Net (86.4%) and SegNet (84.8%).
